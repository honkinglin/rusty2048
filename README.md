## üé¨ Replay System

The CLI version includes a comprehensive replay system that allows you to:

### Features
- **Record Games**: Automatically record all moves during gameplay
- **Save Replays**: Save completed games with metadata
- **Play Back**: Watch replays with full playback controls
- **Speed Control**: Adjust playback speed (0.5x to 4x)
- **Step Through**: Move forward/backward one move at a time
- **File Management**: Organized storage in `cli/replays/` folder

### File Format
Replay files are saved as JSON and include:
- Complete game configuration
- Initial board state
- All moves with timestamps
- Final statistics and metadata
- Player information and notes

### Usage
1. Press **P** during gameplay to enter replay mode
2. Choose **1** to start recording a new game
3. Play normally - all moves are automatically recorded
4. Press **S** to stop recording and save
5. Choose **2** to load and play back saved replays

## ü§ñ AI Mode

The CLI version includes an advanced AI system that can play the game automatically:

### AI Algorithms
- **Greedy**: Simple algorithm that chooses the move with highest immediate score
- **Expectimax**: Advanced search algorithm that considers future moves and random tile placements
- **MCTS**: Monte Carlo Tree Search with UCB1 formula for optimal decision making

### Features

- **Speed Control**: Adjust AI move speed from 100ms to 2000ms
- **Algorithm Switching**: Switch between different AI algorithms in real-time
- **Real-time Status**: Display current algorithm, auto-play state, and speed
- **Non-blocking**: AI runs smoothly without blocking user input

### Usage
1. Press **I** to enter AI mode
2. Press **O** to start auto-play
3. Use **[ ]** to switch between algorithms
4. Use **+/-** to adjust speed
5. Press **Q** to exit at any time

## üìä Statistics Charts
